                    Dudhsagar Falls, one of India’s tallest and most magnificent waterfalls, is located on the Mandovi River in Goa. Aptly named “Dudhsagar,” meaning “Sea of Milk,” the falls cascade down from a height of over 1,000 feet, creating a powerful rush of water that resembles flowing milk. Surrounded by lush greenery and nestled within the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary, this four-tiered waterfall offers a striking contrast between the emerald forest and the white, foaming waters that cascade over rugged rocks.
